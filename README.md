A collection of verification, validation, and performance (VVP) test suites for [MC/DC](https://github.com/mcdc-project/mcdc).

The repository provides a unified framework for launching, processing, and organizing MC/DC-VVP campaigns on local workstations and HPC platforms.
Each suite is self-contained and can be executed independently, while the top-level workflow enables reproducible campaign-wide execution.
Workflow orchestration is performed using [Maestro](https://github.com/llnl/maestrowf).

MC/DC-VVP uses **suite**, **case**, and **task** as standard terms for its organizational hierarchy:

```text
suite
└── case
    └── task
```

- A **suite** is a self-contained collection of related VVP cases with a shared launch and processing workflow.
- A **case** is one individual problem definition and its inputs, reference solution or data, and processing logic.
- A **task** is one execution of a case at one sampling level, such as one `N_particle` or `N_active` value.

A suite contains cases, and each case generates one or more tasks from the suite's `task.yaml` configuration.
Maestro currently represents each case as one workflow step, and `run_case.py` executes that case's tasks sequentially.
The hierarchy also defines restart behavior: an existing output skips its task, a case with all task outputs is omitted, and a suite with all cases complete does not launch.
Every integrated suite provides a README that describes its layout, configuration, workflow, and cases.

## Adding content

To add a case, create its directory under the appropriate suite's `cases/`, implement the common files described in the suite README, and register its task sequence in the suite's `task.yaml`.
Place data shared by multiple cases in the suite's `data/` directory when appropriate.
A new suite should provide its own README, `launch.py`, `process.py`, and `cleanup.py`, then be registered in `configs/launch_config.py.template`.

## Configuration

Create the local launch configuration:

```bash
cp configs/launch_config.py.template configs/launch_config.py
```

Edit `configs/launch_config.py` to enable the desired suites and set their platform and launch options.
Use `platform=None` for local execution or a name from `configs/platform_config.py` for HPC execution.
For HPC execution, `N_node` sets the number of nodes and each node uses all available CPU cores.
The parallel-performance suite instead uses `N_node_max` to generate every power-of-two node count through that value.
For HPC execution, a suite's base `walltime` in hours is scaled by each case's `walltime_factor` in that suite's `task.yaml`.
The scaled value is rounded up to the scheduler's supported resolution, the platform maximum remains the final limit, and local execution ignores walltime settings.
Cases with every expected output are skipped, while partially complete cases retain their existing outputs and run only the missing sampling levels.
Run the top-level `python cleanup.py` before launching when the entire configured campaign should start fresh.

For HPC execution, also create `configs/user_config.py` from its template and provide the account and optional queue, reservation, and Python paths for the target platform.

## Launching and processing

Launch locally enabled suites configured with `platform=None`:

```bash
python launch.py
```

Launch enabled suites configured for a specific HPC platform:

```bash
python launch.py --platform tuolumne
```

The `--platform` option selects suites with a matching configured platform.

Process registered suites and collect their results:

```bash
python process.py
```

For each suite registered in `configs/launch_config.py`, the top-level processor invokes the suite processor when a Maestro run is available and then moves the generated `results/` directory under the same suite path in the top-level `results/` directory.
An existing suite `results/` directory can still be collected when no Maestro run is present, and suites with neither are skipped.
Within each suite, `convergence/` contains study-wide convergence figures and `comparison/` contains plots or animations from the largest-statistics result.
Collecting a suite replaces that suite's existing top-level results.

Prepare the collected PNG and GIF figures for upload as GitHub release assets:

```bash
python prepare_release.py
```

The script recreates `release/`, copies every figure from `results/`, and replaces each directory boundary in its relative path with `--` to form a unique flat asset name.
The structured files in `results/` are not modified.

Remove generated case outputs and processed results from every registered suite:

```bash
python cleanup.py
```

Cleanup removes Maestro run directories and retains reference data.

## Suites

### Analytical verification

Analytical verification demonstrates the expected statistical convergence of MC/DC by comparing numerical solutions against analytical and semi-analytical reference solutions as the sampling effort is increased.

| Physics | Suite | Description |
| :------ | :---- | :---------- |
| Neutron transport | [Fixed-source](verification/analytical/neutron/fixed_source/README.md) | Multigroup steady-state and transient cases, including a two-group manufactured solution, Reed's problem, AZURV1 variants, and infinite SHEM-361 benchmarks. |
| Neutron transport | [k-eigenvalue](verification/analytical/neutron/k_eigenvalue/README.md) | Homogeneous and Kornreich-Parsons one-group slab benchmarks, plus infinite homogeneous SHEM-361 cases. |

### Code-to-code verification

Code-to-code verification assesses whether relative differences among independently implemented transport codes decrease at the expected statistical rate as their sampling effort increases.
Convergence proportional to $N^{-1/2}$ supports that the participating codes are approaching the same solution at the expected Monte Carlo rate, although agreement alone cannot exclude shared bias.
The arithmetic mean of all participating code estimates at the largest sampling level defines a fixed comparison reference for every level, allowing a case to include two or more codes without designating one as exact.

| Physics | Suite | Description |
| :------ | :---- | :---------- |
| Neutron transport | [Code-to-code](verification/code_to_code/neutron/README.md) | Time-dependent C5G7 and Kobayashi comparisons among participating codes. |

## Validation

Validation suites compare MC/DC predictions against experimental measurements.

*Coming soon.*

## Performance

The [performance suites](performance/README.md) evaluate computational performance, scalability, and efficiency across supported execution platforms.
The [parallel-performance suite](performance/parallel/README.md) begins with the Kobayashi analog problem on Dane.
The [serial-performance suite](performance/serial/README.md) will be defined by its separate study plan.

## Documentation

The top-level and suite READMEs provide the repository-specific documentation for MC/DC-VVP.
